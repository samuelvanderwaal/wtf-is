# WTF Is

I was tired of looking up Metaplex program errors.

```bash
wtf-is <hex_code || decimal_code>
```

Example:

```bash
$ wtf-is 0x37
> 0x37: 
        Token Metadata            |     CannotUnverifyAnotherCreator: You cannot unilaterally unverify another creator
```

```bash
$ wtf-is 55
> 0x37: 
        Token Metadata            |     CannotUnverifyAnotherCreator: You cannot unilaterally unverify another creator
```
